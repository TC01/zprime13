This repository is a collection of 13 TeV Z' analysis code, specifically for
the following analyses:

* Z' -> Tt (T -> bW) (semileptonic)

# Contents

## Scripts

This directory contains the scripts that do the actual analysis, and were
ported from the 8 TeV versions [partially available here](https://github.com/osherson/Zprime_to_tT).
